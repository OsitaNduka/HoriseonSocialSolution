# Description

This website was created for a Horiseon Social Solution Services. The website contains many information such as Search Engine Optimization, Online Reputation Management and Social Media Marketing. it also contains Lead Generation, Brand Awareness and Cost Management information.

The Search Engine Optimization (SEO) allows you to increase your visibility and find the right customers.

The Online Reputation Management gives you the control over what potential customers see when they search for your business.

The Social Media Marketing helps you determine which platform are best suited to your brand, using analytics to find the right markets and increase your lead generation. The Horiseon social solution services website was structured in a way that users can easily find and read the useful informations. 

Horiseon website was created using Fluid Design or Responsive design to make sure that the website should scale with the user screen size by adding "meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" in the head of HTML and using percentages for height and width instead of pixels, this way when someone resizes their browser window, the Html tags will shrink or expand accordingly and not break the page. 

This will make it easy to view the website on many different devices and easy to use and easy on the eye, no matter which devices its viewed on.

I also used the @media breakpoints in the CSS file, this will cause the CSS file to use different CSS styles based on the screen size of the device its on. /*MEDIA QUERIES*/.

This website was deployed using GitHub pages so that I can share it with anyone who can visit it using a unique address known as Uniform Resource Locator (URL) on the internet or the World Wide Web(www.Horiseon.com).
